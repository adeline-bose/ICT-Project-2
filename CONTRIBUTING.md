Contribution Guidelines

We're excited to have you contribute to the project! To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, please follow these guidelines.

1. Repository Access & Permissions

Main Branch: The main branch is protected. All changes must be made through a pull request (PR), which requires at least one (1) approval from another team member before merging.

Team Access: Team members have write access to create and push feature branches.

Client Access: The client (Mr. Kuenga) has read-only access for transparency.

2. Feature-Branch Workflow

All new development must be done in a feature branch. Do not commit directly to main.

Branch from Main: Always create your new branch from the latest version of main.

Branch Naming: Name your branch using the format: feature/US-{number}-{short-description}.

Example: feature/US-45-user-login-form

Commit Your Work: Commit regularly with clear messages (see format below).

Open a Pull Request: When your feature is complete and tested, open a pull request to merge your branch into main.

Review Process: At least one other team member must review your code. Address any feedback or requested changes.

Merge & Clean Up: Once your PR is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into main. You should then delete your feature branch.

3. Commit Message Format

Please follow this format for all commit messages to maintain a clear and traceable history.

Format: [US-{number}] {Brief description of changes}

Example: [US-12] Add photo upload validation

4. Task Management (GitHub Projects)

We use the GitHub Project board to track all user stories, bugs, and tasks.

Workflow Columns: Tasks move through the following stages:

Backlog: All planned tasks.

In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.

Review: Tasks with an open pull request, ready for code review.

Done: Tasks that have been merged into main.

Traceability: It is crucial to link all your commits and pull requests back to their corresponding issues on the project board.

5. Documentation

All project documentation is organized as follows:

README.md: Contains the primary project description, feature list, and setup/installation instructions.

CONTRIBUTING.md: (This file) Outlines our code standards, branch strategy, and PR process.
