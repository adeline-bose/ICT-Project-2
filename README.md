# ScrapSmart: Online Scrap Marketplace

ScrapSmart is a full-stack web application designed to be a seamless, transparent marketplace connecting scrap sellers with buyers. The platform allows sellers to list their scrap materials, and buyers to browse, filter, and purchase them.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. User Authentication
* **Dual Roles:** Separate registration flows for "Buyers" and "Sellers. "Admin" roles can be assigned only by modifying the `role` column directly from the database"
* **Account Management:** Secure login and registration system.
* **PHP Backend:** Forms are set up to post to a PHP backend (`src/login.php`, `src/register.php` etc).

### 2. Seller Dashboard (`seller.html`)
* **List New Scrap:** A detailed form for sellers to list new items (title, type, weight, photo, description, price, location).
* **Manage Listings:** View all current listings, with options to edit or delete.
* **Recent Activity:** A feed showing recent orders, inquiries, and reviews.

### 3. Buyer Marketplace (`listings.html` & `scrap-detail.html`)
* **Browse & Search:** A full marketplace page to browse all available scrap.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter listings by category (e.g., Metal, Electronics, Batteries, Automotive).
* **Detailed View:** Each listing has a detailed page showing:
    * Image gallery
    * Item specifications, description, and condition
    * Key stats (available quantity, minimum order)
    * Seller information and rating
* **Purchase Workflow:** Buyers can select a quantity, see a full price breakdown, and proceed to "Purchase" or "Send Inquiry."

### 4. Database Structure
* **MySQL Database:** The project is powered by a MySQL database named `scrap_smart`.
* **Users Table:** Stores user information, including their `role` ('buyer', 'seller', 'admin').
* **Scrap Requests Table:** Manages all scrap listings, tracking their name, type, weight, price, and `status` ('pending', 'accepted', 'completed', etc.).
